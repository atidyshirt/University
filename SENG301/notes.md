</center>

### Course Information

The Software Engineering (Part II) builds on the material introduced in SENG201 (Introduction to Software Engineering) and is intended as a companion course to SENG302 (Software Engineering Group Project).

In this paper, you will learn about software processes, including Agile Software Development (e.g., Scrum, Kanban), effective source code and documentation management, resilience engineering, acceptance testing, software metrics and software design principles.

At the end of each lecture it is expected to finish the prep slides before the next lecture
