### Introduction to Databases 

#### Data Management
- Entity
    - Is something that we have to collect data about
- Attribute
    - Is something we assign to a value, ie if we have an entity called person, 
      the person will have a name attribute
- Data
    - Must be well organized
    - we need to have a system in order to access it efficiently
- Record

**Why We Use Databases**

We use databases to store our information rather then files, this is because
working with files becomes a problem for a number of reasons, these include
having information located in different files and locations. This is a problem
for querying information and manipulating data
