# Markdown template for reports
A simple template for writing reports in [Markdown](http://commonmark.org/) using
[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) for school/college/university/whatever.

## Typeset
Just call `make`. Edit `Makefile` for any customization purposes.

## Replacing sample data
Edit the `cover.tex` file with the name of students and supervisor(s).

The `template.tex` file work as a template for LaTeX and preamble for LaTeX.  Edit this file for
using other packages, settings etc.

Lastly you want to remove the directories filled with Markdown files and write your own. Add the new
files to the `index.txt` file.
