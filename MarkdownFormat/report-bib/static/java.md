\chapter{Static languages}

## Java
Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent,
class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few
implementation dependencies as possible.

```java
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
