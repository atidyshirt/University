_In what circumstances should communities seek advice from scientists for new inititives?_

`Draft One`

One of the biggest upcoming questions in computer science or general science for that matter is the availability of information, I think that we need to make sure that this information is freely available for the general public, this would ensure that people are able to get accurate information that is not restricted by pay-walls, diluted by fake information. If this were to happen, we would have a medium through which information can be learned or seen, leading to a more educated general public and less misunderstanding in the public. We need to address Computer Scientists in this process, this is a big question in the industry right now, for companies like facebook, google and most other major news/social media platforms.

`Draft Two`

One of the major issues that technology is facing at the moment is how to deal with the problem of making information available and reliable for the general public, this may seem like a straight forward idea however there is many things to consider when trying to achieve this. In order to do this we should seek professionals in a number of different fields including computer science. It is important for us to consult computer scientists or related fields because we need to be able to avoid bias when dealing with large amounts of information, We have developed systems to do this such as Google's Page Rank algorithm, we also need to address filtering of misleading or insensitive content, this is particularly important as it creates a breeding ground for groups of people to come up with extreme racial or misogynistic views. This is one situation where I think computer scientists could have a real world impact on the community.
