_In what circumstances should communities seek advice from scientists for new inititives?_

`Draft Two`

One of the major issues that technology is facing at the moment is how to deal with the problem of making information available and reliable for the general public, this may seem like a straight forward idea however there is many things to consider when trying to achieve this. In order to do this we should seek professionals in a number of different fields including computer science. It is important for us to consult computer scientists or related fields because we need to be able to avoid bias when dealing with large amounts of information, We have developed systems to do this such as Google's Page Rank algorithm, this is of particular importance when dealing with misleading or insensitive content, this must be addressed as websites can become a breeding ground for groups of people with extreme racial or misogynistic views to become radicalised, like that of the tragic mosque shooting in Christchurch. This is one situation where I think computer scientists could have a real world impact on the community.
