# What is Science?

I study Computer Science at the University of Canterbury. I come from a wealthy 
European/New Zealander family, because of this I have never fallen victim to racism
or prejudice as people from other upbringings might. On my road to studying science
I initially thought I was going to study commerce, after High School I decided I 
would be more suited to Computer Science and enjoyed it much more.

Computer science is often portrayed as a white male dominated profession and stereotypically
seen as a field of people with a distinct lack in communication skills.
