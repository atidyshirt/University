# What is Science?

I study Computer Science at the University of Canterbury. I come from a wealthy
European/New Zealander family, because of this I have never fallen victim to racism
or prejudice as people from other upbringings might. On my road to studying science
I initially thought I was going to study commerce, however I really enjoyed tinkering with
computers. After a bit of thought I decided I wanted to study computer science and
hopefully somehow develop this into a business.

Computer Science is a relatively new school of science, it is still evolving rapidly
and is constantly changing. Historically Computer Science was a study of physical hardware
but it has now shifted to incorporate both tangible and non-tangible states (Dasgugta, 2014). The study
of Computer Science varies from other scientific domains as it is not concerned with the
study of natural law like physics and chemistry; but concerned with purpose, it is the
study of the artificial, we measure success by efficiency, practicality and usage (Dasgugta, 2014).
As an artificial science, it is closer related to the social sciences then that of the traditional
sciences. Computer Scientists use both inductive and deductive logic to rationalize. An example of how a
computer scientist might use deductive logic is providing a general interface for most users and then
creating more features to provide to a specialized group of users.

Computer science is a white male dominated profession and that has not changed
in the last decade (Allison, 2016). Stereotypically Computer Science is seen as
a field of people with a distinct lack in communication skills. Although I am not
helping the diversity statistics associated with Computer Science, I have a good
set of social skills and have been able to connect with many people in the past,
and believe this to be a great asset within the industry. In Laura Snyder's TED talk,
she names some statistics of how many American people have a basic understanding of
scientific litrature. She reveals shocking statistics that only 28% of American people
have a bisic understanding of scientific litrature (Snyder, 2012). This highlights the
importance of communication and making information available and readable. We should not
be writing in such a way that appeals to those in our field, but that we should be reporting
so the world can understand our findings. Unfortunately the current system and availibility
of scientific knowledge is not perfect, with companies withholding research and information
for profit rather then education (Snyder, 2012). Like Snyder, I think we have lost our way
with how we report findings, and as Snyder said in her TED talk, Science should not only be
for Scientists (Snyder, 2012).
