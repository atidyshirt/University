### What is scientific thinking?

**Empericism**
- is the action of gaining knowledge through senses
- tries to answer questions like; how do we know what we know?
- we read knowledge from`the book of nature`
- our senses are misleading
    - example: wind chill does not reflect the temperature of the air
    - we only percieve things, not see them how they are

**David Deutsch**

His View:
- From an individual's point of view, things never improved
- Enlightenment: rebellion against authority in regards to knowledge
- Scientific theories are testable
- Scientific frame of mind: come up with a *good* explanation
His Criteria to be Scientific
- Scientific theories are explanations
    - Assertions about what is out there and how it behaves
- Scientific assertions are not founded on anything specific

A scientific explanation is not like myth in the sense that we have a reason to believe. The table
below will highlight the key differences between myths and scientific thought.

| Myth                                              | Scientific thought                       |
| ---                                               | ---                                      |
| explanation is hard to vary                       | explanation is easy to vary              |
| components have to have a functional role         | components do not have a functional role |
| it has **reach**; can be applied to other planets | does not have reach                      |

#### Key Points
1. An explanation is an assertion about what's there, unseen, that accounts for what is seen.
2. A scientific explanation should be hard to vary.
3. It's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable.

#### Assignment One - 2nd August
- Marking criteria is on Learn
- Deadline margin is 5% per day

### Origins of Scientific Reasoning

1. Use the theory of evolution as a lens of understanding
2. Demonstrate that scientific reasoning might have been around for at least 2 million years.

#### Human design
- Bipedal
- Born to run - endurance
- Cool through sweating
- Hairless
- Poor sense of smell
- Rely mostly on vision to probe the environment
    - because of this, we are very good at persistence hunting (30-40km running down animals)

#### Inductive reasoning
- If we have seen something before
    - This allows us to understand what it is

**Key Point**
- Evolution + Human Anatomy + Current models of persistent hunting + Paleoanthropology

The combination of the above factors provides a resonable explanation of why hypothetico-deductive reasoning developed
