### What is scientific thinking?

**Empericism**
- is the action of gaining knowledge through senses
- tries to answer questions like; how do we know what we know?
- we read knowledge from`the book of nature`
- our senses are misleading
    - example: wind chill does not reflect the temperature of the air
    - we only percieve things, not see them how they are

**Karl Popper**
- Learn about falsification

**Thomas Kuhn**
- believed most of scientific work is mop up work
- believed that we disregarded things that disagree with our view
- Tried to stucture scientific revolutions and how they happened
    1. First we have contending schools and gathering random facts
    2. One paradigm becomes dominant and becomes normal science
    3. talks about an anomaly that either we cannot get past or we progress with this theory
    4. eventually we find a crisis that means our theory is not quite right
    4. Believed that we had to wait for old scientists to die in order to have a chance of scientific revolution
    5. eventually if we fix enough problems with our theory, we can achieve scientific revolution

Problems: Kuhn's theory does not map well to social sciences, his idea of nessasary death of old scientists is a weel argument, challenging the idea of mastery and progress implicit in Kuhn's work.

**David Deutsch**

His View:
- From an individual's point of view, things never improved
- Enlightenment: rebellion against authority in regards to knowledge
- Scientific theories are testable
- Scientific frame of mind: come up with a *good* explanation
His Criteria to be Scientific
- Scientific theories are explanations
    - Assertions about what is out there and how it behaves
- Scientific assertions are not founded on anything specific

A scientific explanation is not like myth in the sense that we have a reason to believe. The table
below will highlight the key differences between myths and scientific thought.

<center>

| Myth                                              | Scientific thought                       |
| ---                                               | ---                                      |
| explanation is hard to vary                       | explanation is easy to vary              |
| components have to have a functional role         | components do not have a functional role |
| it has **reach**; can be applied to other planets | does not have reach                      |

#### Key Points
1. An explanation is an assertion about what's there, unseen, that accounts for what is seen.
2. A scientific explanation should be hard to vary.
3. It's only when an explanation is good that it even matters whether it's testable.

#### Assignment One - 2nd August
- Marking criteria is on Learn
- Deadline margin is 5% per day

### Origins of Scientific Reasoning

1. Use the theory of evolution as a lens of understanding
2. Demonstrate that scientific reasoning might have been around for at least 2 million years.

#### Human design
- Bipedal
- Born to run - endurance
- Cool through sweating
- Hairless
- Poor sense of smell
- Rely mostly on vision to probe the environment
    - because of this, we are very good at persistence hunting (30-40km running down animals)

#### Inductive reasoning
- If we have seen something before
    - This allows us to understand what it is

**Key Point**
- Evolution + Human Anatomy + Current models of persistent hunting + Paleoanthropology

The combination of the above factors provides a resonable explanation of why hypothetico-deductive reasoning developed

**The Omphalos hypothesis**
- The universe was created by a got a few thousand years ago, this is the reason evolution happened

**Spaghetti Monsterism**
- The universe was created by a badly inebriated invisible and undetectible being *Alien*

**Last Thusdayism**
- The unverse was created last Thursday

> The above are some examples of human thought's. this is called the **Undertirminaton of theory by evidence**

The key idea is that we can determine that many theories can be true if the science supports a single point, it is important to note that
science is not in the business of proving theories with 100% certainty.

#### Deduction versus induction

Example of a deductively valid argument:

Premise 1:
- If sally will go to the party, then fred will go to the party.

Premise 2:
- Sally will go to the party.

Conclusion:
- Fred will go to the party.

> To say that an argument is *deductively valid* is to say that it is impossible for its conclusion to be false if its premises are all true

> Deduction is based off of proof

Example of a inductively strong argument:

Premise 1:
- Bert is 100 years old.

Premise 2: 
- Bert has got arthritis

Conclusion:
- Bert will not run a 5 minute mile tomorrow.

> To say that an argument is *inductively strong* is to say that it is improbable, but not impossible for its conclusion to be false if its
> premises are all true.

> Inductive reasoning is saying that if we find a few instances of something, we can conclude that it is always true

### Maori Background

#### Maori Knowledge (Matouranga)

**Matauranga**

What is Matauranga Maori mean?

Translated directly to Knowledge, it is not the only word used but it is the most common
translation.

Maori Knowledge is not an alternative to science, neither do they claim it to be. Science
and Maori beliefs are two independent Entities.

**Whakapapa**

Whakapapa, means *Genealogical table*
- Translates to place in layers
- the world was ordered and understood by whakapapa's

Formal introductions and Mihi's use GPS, we introduce mountains, rivers, people and place
rather than introducing them via names.

The word means social history and kinship

#### Mihimihi Assessment

Is a greeting, to acknowledge and thank.

A Mihi is an introductory speech and used as a formal greeting.

Located within a Maori perspective: takanga (process) whakapapa (geneology) and
te aro.
