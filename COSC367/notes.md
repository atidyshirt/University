### Foundations of computational agents

Artificial Intelligence is the field that studies the *synthesis and analysis of
computational agents that act intelligently.*

**Definitions**

- Agent
  * An agent is something that acts in an environment; it does something. Agents
    includes, worms, dogs, thermostats, airplanes, robots, humans, companies and countries.
  * is considered intelligent when:
    + what it does is appropriate for its circumstances and its goals, taking into account the short-term and long-term consequences of its actions
    + it is flexible to changing environments and changing goals
    + it learns from experience
    + it makes appropriate choices given its perceptual and computational limitations
