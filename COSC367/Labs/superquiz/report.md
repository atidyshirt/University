# Map Algorithm Data

Here is an example of the A\* algorithm traversing a map string, the agent can pick up fuel,
traverse the space until it reaches a goal node, note the border and X characters are considered walls
and cannot be moved through, `.` identifies places popped and `*` identifies the selected path.

```
+------------+
|         X  |
| S    XXXX G|
|   X  X     |
|   X     X  |
|   X  X  X X|
+------------+

```

The output (traversed graph) is as follows:

```
+------------+
|.........X  |
|.S****XXXX*G|
|...X.*X****.|
| ..X.***.X  |
|   X  X  X X|
+------------+

```
