subject: "COSC368"
subtitle: "The course provides an introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). HCI is concerned with understanding, designing, implementing and evaluating user-interfaces so that they better support users in carrying out their tasks. On completing the course you will have knowledge of the theoretical foundations of designing for interaction between humans and computers. You will also have practical experience in implementing and evaluating graphical user interfaces."

## Lectures

### Lecture One - Introduction

**Technologies in this course**

- TKinter
  * Lab one - Refresher
  * Lab two - Keyboard GUI
  * Canvas & fitts law GUI
- Python

> NOTE: Labs will be used as the basis for analysis in assessments, so we need to build them

**What is HCI?**

Human computer interaction (HCI) is a discipline concerned with the design evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human
use, and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.

**What is HCI Responsible for?**

1. Learnability
2. Efficiency
3. Subjective satisfaction
4. *Memorability*
  * Mostly encapsulated in Learnability
5. *Errors*
  * Opposite of Efficiency

### Lecture Two - Goals of HCI

**Knowing the user: Preliminary Factors**

- safety considerations
- need for throughput
- Frequency of use
- Physical space, lighting, noise, pollution
- Social context
- Cognitive factors: age, fatigue, stress, focus

**Managing complexity**

- Poorly designed interfaces amplify complexity
- Well designed UI's make interfaces as simple as possible, but no simpler
- Sometimes it may be appropriate to over-simplify *cater to an audience*

**Models of Interaction**

- A model is a simplification of reality
- They are useful when they help us understand a complex artifact

**Don Norman's Model of Interaction**

- Helps understand the designer's role in creating a system that is used by a thinking person
- Generally designers have a design model that is incomplete
- Then we get a system image, that is working, but in high incite, we would have
  built it differently
- The user has a model, that is weak, we need to try to map the designers model
  with the user model to create a mapping of the system image.
