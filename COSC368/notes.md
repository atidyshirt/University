subject: "COSC368"
subtitle: "The course provides an introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). HCI is concerned with understanding, designing, implementing and evaluating user-interfaces so that they better support users in carrying out their tasks. On completing the course you will have knowledge of the theoretical foundations of designing for interaction between humans and computers. You will also have practical experience in implementing and evaluating graphical user interfaces."

## Lectures

### Lecture One - Introduction

**Technologies in this course**

- TKinter
  * Lab one - Refresher

> NOTE: Labs will be used as the basis for analysis in assessments, so we need to build them

**What is HCI?**

Human computer interaction (HCI) is a discipline concerned with the design evaluation and implementation of interactive computing systems for human
use, and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.

**What is HCI Responsible for?**

1. Learnability
2. Efficiency
3. Subjective satisfaction
4. *Memorability*
  * Mostly encapsulated in Learnability
5. *Errors*
  * Opposite of Efficiency
