1. User interface modes and Normans model of interaction

a. What is a user interface mode?

> A user interface mode is an assessment of the interface that is based on the users knowledge of the state, if the user has complete knowledge of all states in the interface then the user interface mode is non-modal.

b. sketch...

c. ...

d. ...

2. Design and formative evaluation

a. What is a user interface story board?

> A user interface storyboard is a high level design that shows both the design of each state and how to flow between the states themselves (how to reach each point in the application), it covers gestures, shortcuts and other interactions involved with switching states.

b. What is a task scenario?

> A task scenario is what the user wants from the interface, these should be split into asociated groups and evaluated as needed. These scenarios should be filtered in order to determine what is high priority and what is low priority and what should not be addressed/outside the scope of the application.

3. HCI Terminology

a. Identify two key differences between saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements

1. `Saccadic` eye movement does rapid movement (900 deg/sec), smooth pursuit is for tracking of smaller movements (100 deg/sec)
2. `Saccadic` movement tends to "jump" as apose to smooth pursuit as it follows movement (such as scrolling)

b. Example of interface with smooth pursuit

> Any scrolling interface must involve the validation of smooth pursuit, as if the scrolling is too fast, the user will loose track and experience jumping in vision (not ideal).

c. Example of interface with saccadic pursuit

> Reaction testing, consider an interface that shows dots of random size and position in order to evaluate reaction time. Users will have to use saccadic pursuit in order to identify the dots quickly and where to jump the mouse (close) to the dot.

**Elaborative/Reduction Tension**

Design elaboration is about exploring ideas. Design reduction is about removing the less suitable designs. Elaboration creates more ideas and designs, reduction does the opposite. Both are important parts of interface design.
