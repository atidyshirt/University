## Hick/Hymans Law of Decision Time

Describes human choice reaction time when optimally prepared

$$ T = a + b \times log_2(n) $$

## Fitts' Law

Describes human aimed pointing time as a function of amplitude of movement (A) and target width (W)

$$ MT = a + b + log_2(\frac{A}{W} + 1) $$

## Steering's Law

Describes an HCI phenomenon that relates to the function:

$$ MT = a + b \times \frac{A}{W} $$

> Predicting the time for a user to navigate through a tunnel e.g. drop down/cascading menu where A is the tunnel length and W is tunnel width

##  Zipf's Law

Using Zipfâ€™ law, which states that you do 20% of something 80% of the time, so showing the top 20% used items would be the move. You can also see in the image that 3 out of 14 items are shown (3/14 is roughly 20%)
