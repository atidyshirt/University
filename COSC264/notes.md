### Introduction to Networking

#### Terminology
| Term         | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------       | -----------                                                                                                       |
| End Stations | These are the items connecting to a user ie a computer, servers etc. these are always connected to other stations |
| Network      | A loose term used in many ways, but essentially is a path for information flow                                    |
| Router       | Connects networks together so data can flow from one network to another                                           |

#### First look at the internet

**Where do routers send traffic?** 
> Routers do not normally generate any traffic of their own, they are there to connect
> networks from point to point, they make routing decisions in order to indicate where
> to send the traffic to.

**How can I connect overseas then?**
> Parts of the internet are owned by service providers. These companies own large cables 
> that go overseas to allow companies to connect their networks to the world, service
> providers sell connectivity for a price, your local internet providers will purchase
> access from the largest providers, the top level service providers tend to provide to
> each other, however this tends to not be paid for as it is a mutual benefit for both
> companies to be more connected.

### Bitwise operations

**Bitwise `AND` Operation**

The `AND` operation works by multiplying each bit in the first string to the bits in the
second string, in the python interpreter, the symbol `~` denotes the bitwise `AND`. The 
following example will multiple two binary numbers.

```python
# Here is a python example of a bitwise AND operation
binary_first = 0b0110110110
binary_second = 0b1100011101

bitwise_first_AND_second = binary_first & binary_second
print(bitwise_first_AND_second)
```
> Result: 01 0001 0100

**Bitwise `OR` Operation**

The `OR` operation works by checking if the bit is equal to *1*, if it is equal to 1 then
put 1, else put 0.

```python
# This is how to preform the bitwise function manually
output = ""
if see == 1:
    output.append(1)
else:
    output.append(0)
print(reversed(output))
```

To actually preform this in python, you would use the `|` operand to denote the `OR` bitwise
function. The following is how to preform this in python.

```python
# Here is a python example of a bitwise OR operation
binary_first = 0b0110110110
binary_second = 0b1100011101

bitwise_first_OR_second = binary_first | binary_second
print(bitwise_first_OR_second)
```
