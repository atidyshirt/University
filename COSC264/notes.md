### Introduction to Networking

#### Terminology
| Term         | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------       | -----------                                                                                                       |
| End Stations | These are the items connecting to a user ie a computer, servers etc. these are always connected to other stations |
| Network      | A loose term used in many ways, but essentially is a path for information flow                                    |
| Router       | Connects networks together so data can flow from one network to another                                           |

#### First look at the internet

##### Conversion Chart

| Term | Approximate Size |
| ---  | -----------------|
| Byte (B) | 8 bits |
| Kilobyte (KB) | 1024 bytes |
| megabyte (MB) | 1024 KB | 
| Gigabyte (GB) | 1024 MB |
| Terabyte (TB) | 1024 GB |
| Petabyte (PB) | 1024 TB | 
| Exabyte (EB) | 1024 PB |

**Where do routers send traffic?** 
> Routers do not normally generate any traffic of their own, they are there to connect
> networks from point to point, they make routing decisions in order to indicate where
> to send the traffic to.

**How can I connect overseas then?**
> Parts of the internet are owned by service providers. These companies own large cables 
> that go overseas to allow companies to connect their networks to the world, service
> providers sell connectivity for a price, your local internet providers will purchase
> access from the largest providers, the top level service providers tend to provide to
> each other, however this tends to not be paid for as it is a mutual benefit for both
> companies to be more connected.

#### Delay - Quality of Service >> Write Types of delay
| Application                          | Data loss     | bandwidth                               | Delay-sensitive   |
| ---                                  | ---           | ---                                     | ---               |
| File Transfer                        | No loss       | Elastic                                 | No                |
| Email                                | No loss       | Elastic                                 | no                |
| Web pages                            | No loss       | Mostly elastic, minimum rate desireable | no                |
| Internet telephony videoconferencing | Loss-tolerant | Audio/Voice: few kbps                   | <= 200 - 250 ms   |
| Streaming audio/video                | Loss-tolerant | same as above                           | a few seconds     |
| interactive games                    | Loss-tolerant | few kbps - 1 mbps                       | few hundred ms    |
| instant messaging                    | No loss       | Elastic                                 | not very, depends |

> The term `elastic` means: these applications have no strict minimum-bandwidth requirements, they are just find with what they get

##### Transmission Delay

This is the time it takes to transmit an entire packet over a link.

The formula for working out transmission delay is as follows $\frac{L}{R}$, where *L = length of packet* and *R = Data rate*, this is
how we can workout the transmission delay, This is generally denoted as $(T_{d})$

Here is an example of how we could solve for this in python:

```python
def transmission_delay(packetLength_bytes, rate_mbps):
    return packetLength_bytes / rate_mbps / 125000
```

##### Propagation Delay

This is the time it takes to transmit a single bit of a packet over a link.

This is the delay in which it takes to propagate the signal, and is denoted by $(T_{d})$. The way we can calculate propagation delay is
to use the formula $\frac{d}{s}$ where *d = the distance* and *s = c i.e. the speed of light in copper wire*

### Bitwise operations

**Bitwise `AND` Operation**

The `AND` operation works by multiplying each bit in the first string to the bits in the
second string, in the python interpreter, the symbol `~` denotes the bitwise `AND`. The 
following example will multiple two binary numbers.

```python
# Here is a python example of a bitwise AND operation
binary_first = 0b0110110110
binary_second = 0b1100011101

bitwise_first_AND_second = binary_first & binary_second
print(bitwise_first_AND_second)
```
> Result: 01 0001 0100

**Bitwise `OR` Operation**

The `OR` operation works by checking if the bit is equal to *1*, if it is equal to 1 then
put 1, else put 0.

```python
# This is how to preform the bitwise function manually
output = ""
if see == 1:
    output.append(1)
else:
    output.append(0)
print(reversed(output))
```

To actually preform this in python, you would use the `|` operand to denote the `OR` bitwise
function. The following is how to preform this in python.

```python
# Here is a python example of a bitwise OR operation
binary_first = 0b0110110110
binary_second = 0b1100011101

bitwise_first_OR_second = binary_first | binary_second
print(bitwise_first_OR_second)
```


### Communication Patterns

##### Unicast
- Only two nodes in the networks involved
- One is the transmitter, the other the receiver, but the nodes can have both roles
- Goal: reproduce exactly at the chosen reciever the bit stream sent by the transmitter
- Example
    - phone connections
    - viewing a web page

##### Broadcast
- One node as sender, all other as recievers
- Goal: reporiduce exactly at all stations in the network the bit stream is sent by the transmitter
- Example
    - Radio
    - TV

##### Multicast
- One node as sender, several but not all recievers
- Goal: reproduce exxactly at some stations in the network the bit stream is sent by the transmitter
- often, in multicast groups all nodes can act as senders
- Example
    - Internet chat
    - Phone confrence

#### Client Server Paradigm

The server allocates an address to each client connected. The client acts by sending requests and then turns off
when it receives its answer, the server will stay on and wait for requests to enter. Servers need to have powerful
programs for all users, this is why most servers are hosted on multiple machines that act as the same address to
connect on

One server has multiple clients, and the server has to provide a request `n` times for `n` users.

#### Peer-to-Peer Paradigm
- Has no centralised network
    - this means that it avoids a single point of failure

A peer to peer network is a two way street, you have to both provide data in order to benefit by getting your service.

> an example of this is torrents - you have to upload in order to gain the download

#### Circuit and Packet Switching

The design of a network is strongly influenced by the traffic it is supposed to carry, this will shape the netowrk.

##### Circuit Switching

**Voice Traffic**

- In today's POTS voice is transmitted digitally, the analog voice signal is A/D-converted with fixed sampling rates and resolution
    - Data rate: 64kbit/s
- The voice data is generated continously at a fixed rate
    - The provider has to be able to provide this rate continuously by the period or the voice quality will drop dramatically
- This is called a continuous bit rate (CBR) data stream
- No one else's connection is allowed to interfere with our own
- Goal: provide the illusion of having your own connection with the end user
    - this is achieved by the server allocating a certain amount of `bandwidth` to your call
    - at the end of the call, the resources are re-allocated to a new user 
- Other examples of CBR data: CBR Video, periodic sensor measurements

> When we are recording audio, we do not take the whole thing, we have a 256 bit storage, and we `sample` the data in order to store it.

**Properties of Circuit Switching**
- A routing descision is only made once
- A connection has its resources guaranteed
- Any bandwidth not used by a connection cannot be re-used by other connections
- Connection setup takes time, it does not pay off when only very little data needs to be transmitted
- Connection setup may fail when no route or insufficient resources are available in the network

##### Packet Switching
- Many data applications naturally have time-varying rates
- called `Variable-bit-rate (VBR)` or `bursty` traffic
- CS-networks are not well suited to VBR traffic

**Properties of Packet Switching**
- Data flows are segmented into packets
- Packets are basic unit of transmission
- Packets consist of:
    - A `packet header` containing meta-information about the packet
    - The `packet payload` 
    - Possibly a `packet trailer` for error detection
- Packets are transmitted individually
- There is no notion of a connection, packets can be sent immediately without having to setup any state or resource reservation
- Congestion *To many cars on the highway* can cause packet loss
    - we allocate *buffer memory* to back these packets, if we run out of memory, we must drop some of the incoming packets
- The internet is a Packet-Switching network
*Conequences*
- Lack of resourcse reservation means there are no guarantees for packet delivery
    - Internet/IP "best effort" service: packet is delivered/not delivered
    - IP's lack of guarantees is compensated in parts by TCP
    - **Routers in packet-switched networks perform more complex processing during information transfer than
switching fabrics in circuit-switched networks**
- Packet size
    - Packet overheads (header, trailer) have fixed size
    - Payload size is variable (within bounds)
    - Tradeoff
        - Small size payload leads to high overhead ratio
        - Small payload size leads to reduced susceptibility to errors
    - Packet size limits can be technology or application driven
        - to long packets might block important packets from being sent for an unacceptable time
- Router will not accept packet until it accepts the whole packet and sees trailer (due to corruption)

**Protocols and Services**
- Packets can get lost, re-ordered, delayed, modified or be tampered with
- Stations (end hosts or routers) can implement procedures to repair these problems
- These procedures run in a distributed fashion (as different stations need to cooperate) and are called **protocols**
- Protocols are rules and procedures underlying data transfer

We need to use sequence numbers in order to keep values in order online (such as if we had
a book, we need to make sure page one is ordered before page two, as if we purely rely on
page one arriving before page two, this will not work as we cannot guarantee that the packet
containing page one will not be lost). This is why we should send timers, and other things included
within the trailer of a packet.

The role of IP in the internet protocol Stack
- IP = Internet Protocol
- There are two protocol versions *4, 6* here we use *IPv4*
- Everything over IP, IP over everything

**IP Addresses**
- Each host is identified by one or more IP addresses
    - A host has many IP addresses as it has network adapters
    - End hosts usually have only one IP address (as we use the one with widest scope)
- The IP address not only identifies the host but also helps the network find the path to this host
- Humans normally do not work with IP directly but with host names such as www.canterbury.ac.nz
- There exists a special service/protocol called the domain name service (`DNS`) which translates to human-readable host names to IPv4 addresses, the internet itself only works
    with IPv4 addresses
- Suppost to be worldwide unique (not really true anymore)
- unacknowledged (post service does not send back feedback)
- no guaranteed order of packets recieved with IPv4 protocol

### Socket Programming

#### TCP Client - Example Workflow

**Functions**

> **Socket()** 
> - Create a socket, this allocates resources and assigns a random unused port number
>
> **Connect()**
> - Establish a connection with the server
>
> **Read()/Write()**
> - Reading and writing from and to the socket, alternatively you could also use **sendto()** or **recvfrom()** which allow you to specify other parameters
>
> **Close()**
> - closes the connection to the socket

#### TCP Server - Example Workflow

> **Socket()** 
> - Create a socket, this allocates resources and assigns a random unused port number
>
> **Bind()**
> - Bind a socket to a particular port number and IP addresss
> 
> **Listen()**
> - Declare whether or not the server will accept incoming connections, allocate resources (queue) for incoming connection requests (TCP)
>
> **Accepts()**
> - Accepts an incomming connection request (take it from the request queue) and create a new socket for this connection, bound to the same port as the socket we called `listen()` on.
>
> **Read()/Write()**
> - Reading and writing from and to the socket, alternatively you could also use **sendto()** or **recvfrom()** which allow you to specify other parameters
>
> **Close()**
> - closes the connection to the socket > that was connected to us

#### UDP Client Example Workflow

> **Socket()** 
> - Create a socket, this allocates resources and assigns a random unused port number
>
> **rcvfrom() / sendto()**
> - Compared to TCP client, no `connect()` system call is necessary
> - Receiver address then has to be supplied to `sendto()`

#### UDP Client with `connect()`

> **Socket()** 
> - Create a socket, this allocates resources and assigns a random unused port number
>
> **Connect**
> - The `connect()` system call supplies a default receiver address
> - `connect()` can be called multiple times to change the default receiver
>
> **Write()**
> - `write()` then sends to the last receiver specified with `connect()`
>
> **Close()**
> - closes the connection to the socket > that was connected to us

#### Using the Socket API in C

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```
**Using `socket()`**

This creates a new socket structure, including allocation of resources like the socket buffer, assigns  a random un-used port number to it 
and returns a file descriptor representing the socket

> `socket()` is non-blocking

Parameter `domain`:
- selects the protocol family to be used for the socket
- options include `AF_INET` for IPv4, `AF_INET6` for IPv6, `AF_APPLETALK` for the appletalk protocol
  - for this course we will only use `AF_NET`

Parameter `protocol`:
- selects the protocol used for the given socket type
- often only one option sensible; then `protocol=0` is a good choice as it sets the default value for protocol

Return value:
- If successful, a file descriptor (>= 0) is returned
- Otherwise -1 is returned, and error code `errno` is set

**Using `bind()`**

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```
- Links a socket to a particular IP address / port number / address family combination
- `bind()` is not blocking

Parameter `sockfd`:
- Denotes the socket
- is just the value returned by the previous `socket()` call

Return value:
- when operation successful: `return 0`
- when operation fails: `return -1`

**`bind()` The `sockaddr` Structure**

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);

// this is to hold any kind of address (allocating memory)
struct sockaddr {
  sa_family_t sa_family;
  char sa_data[14];
}

// Contains all the things that we need to specify an address
struct sockaddr_in {
  short sin_family;
  unsigned short sin_port;
  struct in_addr sin_addr;
  char sin_zero[8];
};

struct in_addr {
  unsigned long s_addr;
}
```

**Using `listen()`**

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include<sys/socket.h>

// This is called by the TCP server
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```

**Using `accept()`**

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```

**Using connect()**

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```

**Helper functions for conversion**

```c
#include <arpa/inet.h>

uint32_t htonl(uint32_t hostlong);
uint16_t htons(uint16_t hostshort);
uint32_t ntonl(uint32_t netlong);
uint16_t ntons(uint16_t netshort);
```
These functions convert from `host(h)` to `network(n)` representation or vice versa
- They exist for 16 bit (short) and 32 bit(long) integers
- These helper functions are described in the man page (section 3)

#### Socket Programming Example

##### Client side TCP

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>
#include <netdb.h>

// This will print errors when they occur and then exit (note errors will be printed to terminal)
void error(const char *msg)
{
  perror(msg);
  exit(0);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  int sockfd, portno, n;
  struct sockaddr_in serv_addr; // address structure
  struct hostent *server; // result of DNS resolver

  char buffer[256]; // buffer for actual data (allocated memory)
  if (argc < 3) { // check number command line arguments
    fprintf(stderr, "usage %s hostname port\n", argv[0]);
    exit(0);
  }
  portno = atoi(argv[2]); // convert port number argument to integer

  // now create socket, protocol=0 
  // for given address family TCP will be used, this is how we define a TCP socket
  // AF_INET >> IPv4, 0 >> default socket
  sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (sockfd < 0) {
    errpr("ERROR opening socket");
  }
}

// gives IP address
server = gethostbyname(argv[1]);
if (server == NULL) {
  fprintf(stderr, "ERROR, no such host\n");
  exit(0);
}

bzero((char *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
bcopy((char *)server->h_addr, (char *) &serv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr, server -> h_length);
serv_addr.sin_port = htons(portno);
if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr)) < 0) {
  error("Error connecting");
}

printf("Please enter the message: ");
bzero(buffer,256);
fgets(buffer,255,stdin);

n = write(sockfd, buffer, strlen(buffer));
if (n < 0) {
  error("ERROR writing to socket");
}

bzero(buffer,256);
n = read(sockfd, buffer, 255);
if (n < 0) {
  error("ERROR reading from socket");
}

printf("%s\n", buffer);

// cleanup and exit
close(sockfd);
return 0;
```

##### Server side TCP

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <netinet/in.h>

void error(const char*msg) {
  perror(msg);
  exit(1);
}

int main(int argc, char*argv[])
{
  int sockfd, newsockfd, portno;
  socklen_t clilen;
  char buffer[256];
  struct sockaddr_in serv_addr, cli_addr;
  int n;

  // check number of command line arguments, port number needed
  if (argc < 2) {
    fprintf(stderr,"ERROR, no port provided\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  // create the socket
  sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd < 0) error("ERROR opening socket");


bzero((char*) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr));
portno = atoi(argv[1]);
serv_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
serv_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;
serv_addr.sin_port = htons(portno);
if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*) &serv_addr, sizeof(serv_addr))<0) error("ERROR on binding");

listen(sockfd,5);

clilen = sizeof(cli_addr);
newsockfd = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*) &cli_addr, &clilen);

if (newsockfd < 0) error("ERROR on accept");

bzero(buffer,256);
n = read(newsockfd,buffer,255);
if (n < 0) error("ERROR reading from socket");
printf("Here is the message: %s\n",buffer);
n = write(newsockfd,"I got your message",18);
if (n < 0) error("ERROR writing to socket");

close(newsockfd);
close(sockfd);
return 0;
}
```

In the assignment, we are asked to do this in python. We can Google socket programming and there will be many tutorials on how to do this

### Network Protocols: Architecture and Basics

We need to have a *Structure* to organize networking software to achieve the following

- Modularity and software re-use
- independence of network technologies (**Transparency**)
- Separation of concerns
- Correctness

This is important because without these things being achieved, we would need to re-write code often as the technology is getting better annually

**Layering**

The internet is structured in such a way that a layer cannot access services of layers that are not at tangents to it, therefore the layer can
only interface with the layer directly below and directly above, this is a method in order to keep us from having to re-write code, and re-design
the internet.

An example of how an interface can help us link through layers is the socket API, this allows us to go up a layer and use tools from this area. This is known as `Assessing an access point`
