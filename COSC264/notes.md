#### Terminology
| Term         | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------       | -----------                                                                                                       |
| End Stations | These are the items connecting to a user ie a computer, servers etc. these are always connected to other stations |
| Network      | A loose term used in many ways, but essentially is a path for information flow                                    |
| Router       | Connects networks together so data can flow from one network to another                                           |

**Where do routers send traffic?** 
> Routers do not normally generate any traffic of their own, they are there to connect
> networks from point to point, they make routing decisions in order to indicate where
> to send the traffic to.

**How can I connect overseas then?**
> Parts of the internet are owned by service providers. These companies own large cables 
> that go overseas to allow companies to connect their networks to the world, service
> providers sell connectivity for a price, your local internet providers will purchase
> access from the largest providers, the top level service providers tend to provide to
> each other, however this tends to not be paid for as it is a mutual benefit for both
> companies to be more connected.
