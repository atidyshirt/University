### Course Information

SENG302 is all about putting all that you have learnt in other courses into a systematic development process to create software as a team. The course does not have many set lectures. The course is set up in such a way that there are several learning opportunities along the way. However, this requires you to have initiative to put yourself out there, seize the opportunity, and learn. The idea is that over the year, you build your personal portfolio of skills with real life examples.  
The focus will be on learning by doing. You will be working on a real-life year-long project with your team within the context of the larger SENG302 community. It will involve SE processes and methodologies, technical, organisational, people/team, leadership, and communication skills.Together, we will cultivate a safe environment for each other to grow (as SEs and as people).
