### Assessment

1. Labs (10%) - attendance and participation:
  * Labs are done individually but you are encouraged to discuss and share with your peers (you are allowed to see each other during labs).
  * Attending one lab each week over the semester automatically gives you full mark: â€“ The tutor will assess your attendance.
  * If you cannot attend one lab session, then a report (along with a justification of student absence) will be required and assessed: 
    - The report needs to be submitted by one week after the missed session.
    - Example: if you miss Tuesday lab on Week X then you are asked to submit a report by Tuesday of Week X+1. 
    - The report needs to be sent to *both* the lecturer and the tutor.
2. Weekly quizzes (20%):
  * They can be found and done on LEARN.
  * 9 quizzes in total.
  * Each quiz contains 10 questions. Each question contains 4 choices such that only one choice is correct.
  * 2 attempts per quiz, such that the highest grade is taken into account.
  * A quiz is given on Friday of Week X, and should be done before Friday of Week X+1 (except for the one released just before the break):
3. Assignment (20%):
  * *Deadline*: 17 September 2021.
  * Small exercises on what has been covered so far.
  * The assignment will be released on LEARN on 20 August 2021. 
  * Your report should be uploaded to LEARN.
4. Final exam (50%)
  * 3-hours duration
  * 25 multiple-choice questions
  * 5 open questions, such that if additional information is needed to solve the problem then it will be provided.
  * Covers all content from all lectures study *definitions, mechanisms, processes*
    * Not expected to remember the code of each standard (e.g. RFC1234)

## Lectures

### Lecture One - Course Introduction

- All materials will be found on learn, including lectures, labs, quizzes
and assignments.
- Course outline available
- Labs must be done in person or a report *will not get full marks if do not attend*
- Labs start next week
- Weekly quizzes go over two lectures each *multi-choice*
- Midterm and final will all be entirely open questions

**Why do we need cyber security**

- Privacy
- Security
- Risk management

**Famous recent attacks**

- Dark hotel attack
  * Targeted phishing attacks using spy-ware
  * Infiltrating guests computers through WIFI networks at hotels
  * Loss of confidentiality
- POODLE attack
  * man in the middle exploit
  * Communications can be decryped and exploited
- EncroChat
  * A communications network and service provider
  * Infiltrated by police in 2020
- WannaCry
  * Loss of availability
  * stolen government hacking tools
  * Worm encrypting files on computers hard drive
    + Was a form of ransom-ware
- Botnet
  * Botnet attacking IoT devices with default admin credentials
  * DDos
  * Loss of availability

Because of these attacks, some users have lost confidence in the service
provided not storing/selling data.

**Course Focus**

- Cryptography as a foundation for information security
- Applications of cryptography
- History of cryptography
- Modern cryptography
  * Block ciphers, stream ciphers
  * public key crypto
  * Hashing and MAC
- Some mathematics
  * Modular arithmetic
  * Number theory
  * Elliptic curves
- Using all of the cryptography
  * Public key infrastructure
  * Secure email
  * TLS (HTTPS)

### Lecture Two - Course Overview

**What is cyber security?**

Definition from the NIST computer security handbook:

- The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the
  integrity, availability and confidentiality of information system resources.
  * Some literature might differentiate between *computer security and cyber security*

**Definitions**

- A threat
  * Represents a potential security harm to an asset
- An attack
  * is a threat that is carried out
- The threat agent
  * carrying out the attack is referred to as an attacker
- A countermeasure
  * Any means taken to deal with an attack
- A residual level of risk to the assets
  * represented by vulnerabilities possibly exploited by threat agents
- **Assets**
  * Computer systems and other data processing, storage and data communication devices
  * OS, system utilities and applications
  * Files and databases and further data
  * Local and wide area network links
- **Vulnerabilities**
  * A computer system can be:
    + Leaky
      - meaning gives access to information through the network, violates confidentiality
    + Corrupted
      - meaning that it does the wrong thing, violates integrity principle
    + Unavailable
      - meaning that it becomes impossible or impractical to use, violates availability 
- Passive attacks
  * Interception
  * Traffic analysis
    + Spoofing, finding information and observing traffic
- Active attacks
  * Altering information and system resources
  * May be hard to prevent but easy to detect
  * Masquerade
    + the attacker claims to be someone else *authorized*
  * Falsification (Man in middle)
    + the attacker changes messages during transmission
  * Misappropriation (DDOS)
    + the attacker prevents legitimate users from accessing resources
- Inside attacks
  * initiated by an entity INSIDE the security perimeter
  * authorization to access system resources but use of them in a malicious way
  * Exposure
    + the attacker intentionally releases sensitive information to an outsider.
  * Falsification
    + the attacker alters or replaces valid data or introduces false data into a file or database.
- Outside attacks
  * initiated from OUTSIDE the perimeter, by an unauthorised or illegitimate user of the system
  * Obstruction
    + the attacker disables communication links or alters communication control information.
  * Intrusion
    + the attacker gains unauthorised access to sensitive data by overcoming the access control protections.

**Security functional requirements**

- Information security management requires to:
  1. Identify threats
  2. Classify all threats according to liklihood and severity
  3. Apply security controls based on cost benefit analysis
- Countermeasures to vulnerabilities and threats comprise:
  1. Computer security technical measures
    + access control, authentication and system protection
  2. Management measures
    + awareness and training
  3. Both
    + configuration management

**Defining Information Security**

Definition from the NIST computer security handbook:

- The term security is used in the sense of minimizing the vulnerabilities of assets and 
  resources. An asset is anything of value. A vulnerability is any weakness that could be 
  exploited to violate a system or the information it contains. A threat is a potential 
  violation of security.

**The CIA Triad**

- Confidentiality
  * Preventing unauthorised disclosure of information
- Integrity
  * Preventing modification or destruction of information
- Availability
  * ensuring resources are accessible when required

**Information Security Definitions**

- Security Service
  * a processing or communication service to give a specific kind of protection to system resources.
  * Types of security services [Lecture Two - Slide 20/27]:
    + Peer entity authentication
    + Data origin authentication
    + Access control
    + Data confidentiality
    + Traffic flow confidentiality
    + Data integrity
    + Non-repudiation
    + Availability
- Security Mechanism
  * a method of implementing one or more security services.
  * Types of security mechanisms
    + Encipherment
    + Digital signature
    + Access control
      - access control lists, password or tokens which may be used to indicate access rights
    + Data integrity
    + Authentication exchange
    + Traffic padding
    + Routing control
    + Notarization

**Risk Management** 

A key tool in information security management:

1. Identify threats
2. Classify all treats according to likelihood and severity
3. Apply security controls based on cost benefit analysis
